# Reporting Authoring

### Q1. Explain relational data Model with example. [6]

### **Relational Data Model in Business Intelligence**

- The **relational data model** is a method of structuring data into **tables (also called relations)** consisting of **rows and columns**.
- Each table represents one **entity type**, and each row in a table is a **record** (also called a tuple), while each column is an **attribute**.
- This model is used widely in **Business Intelligence (BI)** to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently for analysis and reporting.


### **Key Concepts:**

* **Table (Relation):** A set of data organized in rows and columns.
* **Row (Tuple):** A single record in the table.
* **Column (Attribute):** A field that describes an aspect of the entity.
* **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table.
* **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another, creating relationships between tables.

---

### **Example: Sales BI System**
-

### **Customer Table**

| **CustomerID (PK)** | Name  | Location |
| ------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| C101                | Alice | Pune     |
| C102                | Bob   | Mumbai   |

---

### **Sales Table**

| **SaleID (PK)** | **CustomerID (FK)** | Product | Quantity | SaleDate   |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| S301            | C101                | Laptop  | 2        | 2024-01-10 |
| S302            | C102                | Phone   | 1        | 2024-01-12 |

---

In this setup:

* `CustomerID` is the **Primary Key** in the **Customer** table.
* `CustomerID` is used as a **Foreign Key** in the **Sales** table to relate sales to customers.


### **Usage in BI:**

* BI tools use this structured relational data to:

  * Run **SQL queries** for reports (e.g., total sales by product).
  * Perform **data aggregation** (e.g., total revenue by location).
  * Enable **dashboards** and **visualizations**.

---

### Q2. Explain multidimensional data model with example. [6]
(Explain the multi-dimensional Data Model with a suitable case study.
What are the Advantages of Multi-Dimensional Data Model? )

### **Multidimensional Data Model in Business Intelligence**

- The **multidimensional data model** is used in **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** systems to organize data into **facts** and **dimensions**, enabling fast and flexible analysis of large datasets.
- Unlike relational data model, this model oxganizes data into multiple dimensions, like a cube.
- This structure allows for faster & more fiexible data analysis, reporting & decision- making
- Each dimension represents a different aspect of the data, like time, location, or product.

### **Key Components:**

1. **Fact Table:** Central table that contains **measurable data** (metrics).
   * Example: Sales amount, quantity.

2. **Dimension Tables:** Tables that describe the different dimensions of the data.
   * Example: Time, Product, Customer, Region.

3. **Cube:** A multidimensional structure formed by combining facts and dimensions.
   * Allows analysis across multiple perspectives (e.g., sales by product, region, and time).

### ✅ **What is Data Grouping?**

- **Data Grouping** is the process of combining rows of data that have the same value in one or more columns to analyze them as a single unit.
- It is the process in BI where data xecards that shaxe a comman value are placed together into one group
- This is commonly used in reports to oxganize & summarize information, such as grouping al sales transactions by region, product, date, etc
- It is commonly used in reports to show **totals, averages, or counts** by group.

**Use:**

* To summarize large data sets
* To generate group-wise totals or summaries (e.g., sales by region)

**Example:**
If a sales table has this data:

| Region | Sales |
| ------ | ----- |
| East   | 1000  |
| West   | 1500  |
| East   | 2000  |
| West   | 1200  |

**Grouped by Region:**

| Region | Total Sales |
| ------ | ----------- |
| East   | 3000        |
| West   | 2700        |

---

2. **Dynamic Filtering** – Filters applied by users during report viewing (interactive)

---

### ✅ **Example:**

Given a sales report:

| Region | Sales |
| ------ | ----- |
| East   | 1000  |
| West   | 2000  |
| North  | 800   |

**Filter:** Show only regions with sales > 1000

**Filtered Report:**

| Region | Sales |
| ------ | ----- |
| West   | 2000  |

- Improves **readability** and **understanding** of data
- It helps in quick decision making especially for identifying issues, spotting outliers

---

**Example:**
In a sales report:

| Salesperson | Sales |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Rahul       | 8000  |
| Priya       | 12000 |
| Aman        | 5000  |

**Rule:** If Sales > 10000 → Highlight cell in **green**

**Result:**

| Salesperson | Sales        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Rahul       | 8000         |
| Priya       | **12000** 🟩 |
| Aman        | 5000         |
